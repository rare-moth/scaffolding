# 👾 Hacktoberfest 2021 🍻

## How to contribute

Each folder in rare-moth/scaffolding repository is stand alone project.

You can either contribute to existing projects or submit your own.

## What is it about

The idea is to create your own front-end framework. A bit like Boostrap but this one is your own.

Use developer best practices:

- Responsive - mobile first design
- YAGNI “You aren’t gonna need it” principle: XP programming, a programmer should not add a functionality until deemed necessary. Please note this does not mean abandoning customisability.
- SoC, Separation of Concerns: Separating a computer program into distinct sections, so that each section addresses a separate concern. It gives you higher degrees of freedom of module reuse as well as independent development and upgrade.

## Requirements

All projects must have a **README.md** file with sesible description of the framework and implementation explanation.

*Happy coding, long live open source* 🖖 👩‍💻 :unicorn:
